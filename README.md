# Lahman Baseball

This project delves deep into America's favorite pastime, exploring player statistics, salaries, and historical trends. From uncovering the shortest player's career to identifying the highest-earning Vanderbilt alumni in the majors, this analysis provides a comprehensive look at the intricacies of the sport.

This analysis contains two parts:
* An initial analysis, answering 10 prompted questions. See the [queries here](https://github.com/jessicabohannon/Lahman-Baseball/blob/main/scripts/lahman.sql).
* An additional open-ended analysis, analyzing the relationship between player age and performance metrics. These findings were visualized and presented. Find the [queries here](https://github.com/jessicabohannon/Lahman-Baseball/blob/main/scripts/lahman_solo.sql) and the [presentation here](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/10kLLsBKMmhSYt99vsoEFAhHr-HNXrhRDgBCgjih-uUA/edit?usp=sharing).

## Skills Showcased:
* Employed advanced SQL techniques such as joins, subqueries, CASE WHEN statements, window functions, set theory, and aggregations to extract meaningful insights from complex datasets.
* Applied sabermetrics principles to evaluate player performance beyond traditional statistics, calculating and examining factors such as on-base percentage and slugging percentage.
* Utilized data visualization techniques to illustrate and communicate key findings.
